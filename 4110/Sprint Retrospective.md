            <td>We were overall satisfied with how the first sprint went. Our project was very presentable and we ran into no issues during our demo. One issue we ran into during our sprint was evenly dividing the work and making sure everyone could easily pick up new tasks to complete. We decided that for future sprints, we would keep a to-do list on Github so that each member can easily claim certain responsibilities if they need something to do. This way, we could also make sure each team member had a chance to contribute equally. </td>

            <td>Sprint Two</td>
            <td>The second sprint turned out very well for us and progress was smooth throughout. Progress on the backend was good, and the overhaul to the interface made it much more organized. The only issues we ran into this sprint were related to communication on certain tasks, as there were more merging conflicts due to certain overhauls in the code. We decided that for the next sprint, we would communicate more to prevent merging conflicts where possible.</td>

            <td>Sprint Three</td>
            <td>The third sprint was rockier but ultimately turned out fine in the end. Our final product was polished, well presented, and easy to use. While progress was initially smooth, several major issues came up near the end of the sprint, as we had to fix and overhaul several pages at the last minute. This issue mainly came down to starting on certain tasks far too late into the sprint, as opposed to completing them sooner. Were we to improve anything for a hypothetical fourth sprint, we would ensure that all tasks are completed as soon as possible so that we have the time to discuss and adequately fix issues.</td>
